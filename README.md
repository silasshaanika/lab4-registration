 Lab 4 Registration

## Student Info
- Name: Your Full Name
- Student Number: 1234

## Description
I made a registration system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to add student profiles, display them as cards, and show them in a summary table.  
Data is saved in LocalStorage so profiles remain after page refresh.

## Features
- Registration form with validation
- Profile cards with photos
- Summary table synced with cards
- Remove feature
- Edit feature
- Persistent storage (LocalStorage)
